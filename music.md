# About

## Dursley Male Voice Choir

#### 13th July - 7:30pm - Crudwell Church

The Dursley Male Voice Choir was founded by a group of enthusistic singinger in 1978 and has since grown to be one of the principal male choirs of the region with up to 70 singers drawn from all over the area. As well as local concerts the choir has performed at many venues across the UK.
The choir has achieved notable success in several competitions on the BBC and HTV in 1982/3/4 and 1986, including being semi–finalists in the BBC Male Voice Choir Choir of the Year competition.Successes also followed in competitions in Cornwall (1990) and to some measure in Huddersfield (1991). First place was also gained in the prestigious Miners’ Eisteddfod in Porthcawl in 1996. More recently in 2009 the choir was awarded third place in the Cornwall International Music Festival against strong competition.

## Sam Salter
<div class="row"><div class="col-sm-8">
Sam was formed in Cornwall in the early 1980s, from just two cells. He is not a mutant, and is not on the run from a shady government organisation. He attended more than a few educational establishments, and several places of employment, some of them rather Far Away, before arriving in Crudwell where he lives on Tuners Lane (in a house). A number of noises were emitted throughout those years, some of which he eventually learned to replicate on demand - and it is those very noises which you may hear if you attend this event.

# It's a musical a-fayre!

This year, to celebrate 30 years, we have a musical theme. There will be performances, workshops and plenty to get involved in throughout the weekend, all kicked off by an evening performance by the Dursley Male Voice Choir on the Firday evening. Of course, there will also be plenty of strawberries and cream!


# Under construction

The website is still under construction. More information about all the musical events will be coming soon!

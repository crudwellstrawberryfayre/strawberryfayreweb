# It's a musical a-fayre!

This year, to celebrate 30 years, we also have a musical theme. There will be performances, workshops and plenty to get involved in throughout the weekend, all kicked off by an evening performance by the Dursley Male Voice Choir on the Friday evening. Of course, there will also be plenty of strawberries and cream!

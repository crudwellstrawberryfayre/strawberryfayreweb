All proceeds from the Strawberry Fayre go to the All Saints Church in Crudwell. This year the money raised will be going towards installing a new sound system. 

The church plays a key role over the Strawberry Fayre weekend, hosting the musical workshops and the popular teddy bear parachute jump on the Sunday morning.
